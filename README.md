Employee Left Prediction
For safe and secure lending experience, it's important to analyze the past data. In this project, a deep learning model is built to predict the chance of employee churn or not using the historical data. This dataset is highly imbalanced and includes a lot of features that make this problem more challenging.

Objective:
Create a model that predicts whether or not an applicant will be able to repay a loan using historical data.

Steps
Load the dataset that is given to you
Check for null values in the dataset
Print percentage of default to payer of the dataset for the TARGET column
Balance the dataset if the data is imbalanced
Plot the balanced data or imbalanced data
Encode the columns that is required for the model
Calculate Sensitivity as a metrice
Calculate area under receiver operating characteristics curve
Setup and Installation:
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip list
